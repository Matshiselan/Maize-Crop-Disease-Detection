# Maize-Crop-Disease-Detection
Maize is Zimbabwe’s most important staple crop, feeding millions and driving rural livelihoods. But yields are increasingly threatened by fungal leaf diseases like Common Rust, Gray Leaf Spot, and Blight—affecting farms across both humid and dry regions, from Manicaland to Masvingo.

Smallholder farmers, who grow most of the country’s maize, often lack tools for early disease detection. Current diagnosis methods rely on manual inspection, which is slow, inconsistent, and hard to scale. As a result, diseases often go untreated until it’s too late, causing serious yield losses, food insecurity, and financial strain.

The accompanying notebook is an AI-powered image classification model that can accurately identify maize leaf diseases. The model can classify images into one of four categories:

* Common Rust
* Gray Leaf Spot
* Blight
* Healthy
